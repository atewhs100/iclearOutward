	Max Consecutive Sum
	Implement a function that calculates the max consecutive sum on a subsequence of integers. What is the maximum sum one can achieve by summing consecutive numbers on a
	finite array of positive and negative numbers? One can start and end anywhere, but it is not allowed to skip numbers.
	For example, consider the array [2, -4, 2, -1, 3, -3, 10, -1, -11, -100, 8, -1].
	The max possible consecutive sum is 11 (starting from the index 2 and ending with the index 6, both zero-based).
